I haven't got enough time to implement another ways to preprocess the images, and neither to learn sufficient about tensorflow to do the models.

Here, i treated the data (traffic signs images from German) and created the predictive models to classificate them. 
Added to the data and the machine learning work, i made a click application to run the models from the console with the click commands.
